        "observations": "The patient's BMI has been consistently high, ranging from 26.24 to 28.86 kg/m², which significantly increases the risk of Type 2 diabetes. The patient's cholesterol levels are also elevated, with LDL levels ranging from 117 to 156 mg/dL and HDL levels ranging from 42 to 56 mg/dL, which further contributes to the risk. The patient's fasting glucose levels are borderline, ranging from 100 to 122 mg/dL, indicating a higher risk of developing diabetes. The patient's HbA1c levels have been consistently above 5.7%, ranging from 3.6% to 4.2%, which is a strong indicator of prediabetes.",
        "patient_advise": "Use the prescribed blood pressure monitoring device to track your blood pressure regularly. Aim to maintain a healthy diet and engage in regular physical activity, such as jogging, to manage your weight and cholesterol levels. Consider incorporating more fiber into your diet to help lower your cholesterol levels by up to 15%.",

        "therapeutic_goal": "Reduce BMI to below 25 kg/m², lower LDL cholesterol to below 100 mg/dL, and maintain HbA1c levels below 5.7% through lifestyle modifications and regular monitoring of blood pressure and glucose levels."

        "observations": "The patient's triglyceride levels are elevated, ranging from 151 to 187 mg/dL, which contributes to the risk of Type 2 diabetes. The patient's HDL cholesterol levels are borderline, ranging from 42 to 56 mg/dL, which is slightly below the optimal range for women (>50 mg/dL). The patient's lifestyle factors, such as occasional alcohol consumption and a balanced diet, may help mitigate some of the risk, but more physical activity could further reduce the risk.",
        "patient_advise": "Incorporate more physical activity into your daily routine, such as brisk walking or cycling, to help manage your weight and improve your cholesterol levels. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, along with muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week.",

The patient's HbA1c levels have been consistently above 5.7%, ranging from 3.6% to 4.2%, which is a strong indicator of prediabetes. The patient's lifestyle factors, such as never smoking and occasional alcohol consumption, may help mitigate some of the risk, but poor sleep and high stress levels could contribute to metabolic dysfunction and increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes.",

High blood pressure is a known risk factor for diabetes, and without this information, it is difficult to accurately assess the patient's risk.
