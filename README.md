# AI Pathology Copilot (Draft)

Welcome to the AI Pathology Copilot project repository. At this time, the project is in the brainstorming and planning phase. While our vision is clear and tasks have been determined, we are still finalizing the technology stack, architecture, and implementation details.

## Project Overview

**AI Pathology Copilot** is envisioned as a multimodal AI-powered assistant designed to help pathologists analyze medical images and interpret pathology reports. The core objectives include:

- **Enhancing Diagnostic Accuracy:**  
  Automatically process pathology images to identify regions of interest and potential abnormalities.

- **AI-Driven Q&A:**  
  Provide intelligent, preliminary answers to pathology-related questions to support report interpretation.

- **Patient Severity Ranking:**  
  Offer a basic ranking system to prioritize patient cases based on combined image and text analysis.

**Note:** The project is still in the conceptual stage. Specific technologies and methodologies are under evaluation.

## Current Status

- **Brainstorming Phase:**  
  We are actively discussing and refining the projectâ€™s vision and goals.

- **Task Determination:**  
  Key tasks and milestones have been outlined to guide the prototype development.

- **Technology Choices:**  
  The final tech stack (backend, frontend, AI models, deployment strategy, etc.) is yet to be decided. We welcome suggestions and contributions in this area!

## Planned Features

While details are still being refined, the following features are under consideration:

- **Image Processing:**  
  Automated processing of pathology images (e.g., JPEG, PNG) to detect regions of interest.

- **AI-Powered Q&A:**  
  Integration of a question-answering system using generative AI to support pathology report analysis.

- **Patient Severity Ranking:**  
  A preliminary system to assess and rank patient cases based on diagnostic inputs.

- **User Interface:**  
  A web-based interface for easy image uploads and interactive AI engagement (potentially using Gradio).
